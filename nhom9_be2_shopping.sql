Iceberg lettuce doesn’t develop deep roots so remember to keep the base of the plant properly moist. If you plan to plant lettuce in a rather warmer zone, protect the plant from direct afternoon sun. Excessive warmth may lead the lettuce plant to bolt and cause a very bitter taste in the leaves. GROWING REQUIREMENTS PESTS Pests to watch out for in iceberg lettuce are aphids, slugs, and caterpillars. In such cases, remove the affected leaf immediately and harvest the remaining leaves. SOIL Prepare the well-drained fertile soil with rich with nutrients which will promote tender leaf development. Soil pH should range between 6 to 7 for ideal growth. SPOT Iceberg lettuce can be planted in full or partial sun. However, protect the plant from direct heat to avoid bolting. TEMPERATURE The ideal temperature for sowing iceberg lettuce seeds is 16-20°C (60-68°F) WATERING Water lettuce carefully so as to keep the soil moist but avoid making a muddy mess which will lead to fungal root disease. Also, keep the leaves of lettuce clear of any splashes of soil which may damage the leaves. HOW TO HARVEST A properly grown iceberg lettuce head picked at the right time will have just the right flavors and taste for your salads and sandwiches. The ideal temperature for harvesting iceberg lettuce is 15-20°C (60-68°F) to avoid bolting. When harvesting the iceberg lettuce head, remove the entire head at the base.', 'Product Dimensions 6 x 5 x 0.5 inches\r\n            Item Weight 1.13 ounces\r\n            Manufacturer Hagao\r\n            ASIN B07DZZS49R\r\n            Item model number 8541836872.\r\n            PESTS:Pests to watch out for in iceberg lettuce are aphids, slugs, and caterpillars.

It has a hard shell, edible white flesh and clear liquid, sometimes referred to as “water,” which is often used as a beverage. Coconut flesh or “meat” is aromatic, chewy in texture and rich in taste. Odour profile: intensely tropical notes, lush, sweet, milky, vanillic, with a suntan lotion association due to the inclusion of coconut scent in Coppertone sun oil.
